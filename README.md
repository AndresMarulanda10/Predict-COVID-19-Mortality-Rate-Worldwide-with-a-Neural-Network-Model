🌎 Prediction COVID-19-Worldwide Mortality Rate based on Neural Networks Model 🧠

This project aims to predict the mortality rate of COVID-19 in each country and the total mortality rate worldwide, using a Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) model. Real-time datasets are used to analyze the impact of various socioeconomic factors, such as population, demographics, gross national product (GNP) per capita, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, political stability, urbanization, government effectiveness, hand-washing facilities, and others.

🔍 Data Sets Used:

🌐 Countries of the World: Information on 227 countries and territories including population, literacy rate, GDP per capita, infant mortality, net migration, population density, area, climate, birth rate, death rate, agriculture, and industry.

🦠 COVID-19 Data: Collection of COVID-19 data, updated daily and maintained by Our World in Data, including variables such as total confirmed cases, total deaths, total tests, new cases, tests units, stringency index, population, population density, median age, people aged 65 older, people aged 70 older, GDP per capita, extreme poverty, COVID death rate, diabetes prevalence, female smokers, male smokers, handwashing facilities, and hospital beds per 100k for a total of 209 countries and territories.

🌍 Worldmeters Corona Data Set: Another source for COVID-19 data for a total of 214 countries and territories, including total confirmed cases, total deaths, total tests, and serious critical cases.

🌐 Worldwide Governance Indicators: Composite governance indicators based on over 30 underlying data sources, rescaled and combined to create six aggregate indicators of dimensions of governance for over 215 countries and territories over the period 1996-2018, which are Voice and Accountability, Political Stability and Absence of Violence, Government Effectiveness, Regulatory Quality, Rule of Law, and Control of Corruption.

👥 Human Rights Data Set: Contains quantitative information on government recognition of 15 internationally recognized human rights in more than 200 countries from 1981-2011. It includes measures of the practices of governments that allow or impede citizens who wish to exercise their physical integrity rights like the rights not to be tortured, summarily executed, disappeared, or imprisoned for political beliefs; civil liberties such as free speech, freedom of association and assembly, freedom of movement, freedom of religion, and the right to participate in the selection of government leaders; employment rights; and rights of women to equal treatment politically, economically, and socially.

👥 Demographic Data: Data for a total of 164 countries from 1960 to 2018, including GNP per capita, inflation rate, industry, life expectancy, total fertility rate, population, migration rate, and political stability.

📊 Analysis:

The attributes considered in this project for predicting worldwide COVID-19 mortality for the period 1st January 2020 to 20 June 2020 are obtained from the above data sets. The number of total confirmed cases and the number of total deaths have been extracted from the COVID-19 data set by filtering the total deaths for each month starting from January 2020 until the 20th of June and combined it to the final data set as new variables.

📈 Conclusion:

The FFNN model, trained on the combined data sets, provides valuable insights into the impact of socioeconomic factors on the mortality rate of COVID-19. This analysis can be used to develop effective policies to combat the pandemic and improve healthcare infrastructure in affected regions.
